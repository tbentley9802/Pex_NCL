      <strong></strong>
      No. If there are 2 Platinum, Sapphire, Diamond, or Ambassador members in one stateroom, only one Welcome Back Card will be delivered. This gives the correct number of Dinner for Two vouchers the guests are entitled to.
For 3rd and 4th Platinum, Sapphire, Diamond, or Ambassador members in the same stateroom, an additional Welcome Back Card will be delivered.
If there is only a 3rd Platinum, Sapphire, Diamond, or Ambassador member in the same stateroom, an additional Welcome Back Card will be delivered but this guest will be treated as a solo traveler who get one dinner only. The benefit is only if there are 2 guests dining on the same visit.            </div> <!-- Close div: faq-answer -->

      <p>As with all programs, specific parameters  are established with the policies/procedures to be followed for the credit of program points. Our promotions are always driven by a booking window and are available for new reservations only. This means that for a reservation to qualify for a promotion, it needs to be made within a certain time frame. For an existing reservation to qualify for a new offer/promotion, it has to be cancelled and re-booked which then changes the booking date on the reservation. If this change is done within 9 months prior to sailing, the reservation is then disqualified from receiving the early booking points. The booked date of your new reservation will be used to determine if you booked 9 months in advance and are eligible for the early booking points.</p>            </div> <!-- Close div: faq-answer -->

      <strong></strong>
      <p>Effective for sailings July 15, 2016 and beyond, guests are prohibited from bringing any beverages -- including liquor, beer and non-alcoholic drinks such as water, soda and juices -- on board either as carry-on or checked luggage, with the exception of purified or distilled water in factory-sealed containers for use in conjunction with medical devices or for the reconstitution of infant formula; and fully sealed and/or corked wine bottles for personal consumption onboard that is subject to screening and a corkage fee (for guests 21 years of age or older). Open beverages of any kind must be consumed or discarded at the security check-point, on embarkation day and at any port of call. This revised policy brings the company in line with other best practice travel security protocols and reduces the need for individual time consuming screening and package inspection of large volumes of beverages.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Why the change in policy?</strong><br />
  The inspection of large volumes of beverages has an impact on the embarkation process and security resources. As one example, guests who attempt to smuggle alcoholic beverages onboard often try to do so in beverage containers.  This means all beverages must be personally screened, taking both time and dedicated personnel.<br />
  This modified policy will now bring us in line with other travel industry procedures for transporting beverages and allow security personnel to focus on other screening efforts and not individually inspecting all beverages being brought onboard. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>What if I purchase a beverage in a port of call?</strong><br />
  Guests will not be permitted to bring any beverages onboard the ship in ports of call and any locally-purchased beverages will be disposed of prior to embarkation. No open containers of beverages, including water, will be allowed onboard during a port of call. <br />
  If you purchase any alcohol at one of our ports-of-call or in our onboard shops, we will safely store your purchase and either on the final night of the cruise or the morning of debarkation it will be available for pick up in a designated area. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>What happens if I bring a case of water to the ship?</strong><br />
  Guests who bring beverages to embarkation will be directed to return the items to their vehicle.  If the guest does not have a vehicle onsite, the items will be disposed of.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>If I need to bring water or milk onboard for a medical reason or infant, what’s the process?</strong><br />
  Guests who have special needs, medical requirements, or families with infants who require water for formula or milk, should contact the access desk at <a href="mailto:accessdesk@ncl.com.">accessdesk@ncl.com</a> to verify if an exception can be made for their beverage and to obtain pre-approval to provide to security at embarkation.<br />
<br />
<strong>Is the water onboard safe to drink?</strong><br/>
All of our ships produce water in accordance with the guidelines and requirements as defined by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Center for Environmental Health.<br/>
<br/>
  <strong>Can I still bring wine on board?</strong><br />
  Yes, guests may bring sealed bottles of wine on board for personal consumption. They will be checked prior to embarkation and a corkage fee applied at that time of $15.00 <span class="usd">USD</span> for a 750 ml Bottle or $30.00 <span class="usd">USD</span> for a 1,500 ml Magnum bottle.

  <strong>Why can I bring wine but not other beverages?</strong><br />
As very few guests bring wine onboard, the team is able to easily and quickly screen these items.</br/></br/></br/></br/></p>            </div> <!-- Close div: faq-answer -->

  <strong>Non-Alcoholic Beverages Policy<br />
  </strong><br />
Effective for sailings July 15, 2016 and beyond, guests are prohibited from bringing any beverages -- including liquor, beer and non-alcoholic drinks such as water, soda and juices -- on board either as carry-on or checked luggage, with the exception of purified or distilled water in factory-sealed containers for use in conjunction with medical devices or for the reconstitution of infant formula; and fully sealed and/or corked wine bottles for personal consumption onboard that is subject to screening and a corkage fee (for guests 21 years of age or older). Open beverages of any kind must be consumed or discarded at the security check-point, on embarkation day and at any port of call. This revised policy brings the company in line with other best practice travel security protocols and reduces the need for individual time consuming screening and package inspection of large volumes of beverages.

      <div class="faq-answer" question_id="what-about-gratuities">
      <strong></strong>
      Unlike most other ships in the cruise industry, there is no required or recommended tipping on our ships for service that is generally rendered to all Guests. While you should not feel obligated to offer a gratuity, all of our staff are encouraged to “go the extra mile,” so they are permitted to accept cash gratuities for exceptional or outstanding service if you care to offer them. Also, certain staff positions (e.g., concierge, butler, youth program staff and beverage service) provide service on an individual basis to only some guests and do not benefit from the overall service charge. We encourage those Guests to acknowledge good service from these staff members with appropriate gratuities. Additionally, there is an 20% gratuity and spa service charge added for all spa and salon services, as well as an 20% gratuity and beverage service charge added for all beverage purchases and an 20% gratuity and specialty service charge added to all specialty restaurant dining and entertainment based dining.            </div> <!-- Close div: faq-answer -->

      <div class="faq-answer" question_id="currency">
      <strong></strong>
      <p>The currency used on board our ships is the U.S. $. We’ve made paying for on-board expenses very easy. When you check in you open a shipboard account by registering a major credit card such as VISA®, MasterCard® or American Express. If you prefer to pay by cash or traveller’s cheques, a suggested deposit for a 7-night cruise is US $ 300 per person, US $ 150 per person for cruises up to 6 nights or US $ 450 per person for cruises of 8 nights and more at check-in (subject to change). Then, you simply sign for your personal expenses as you go and they will be charged to your account.</p>
<p><b>Important</b>: When your credit card is entered to activate your on-board account, an initial approval is obtained from the bank. Please be advised that some banks may hold the pre-authorisation for up to 30 days. Throughout the voyage incremental holds will be obtained based on your on-board expenditure. This will reduce the amount of available credit on the credit card or restrict the availability of cash in your bank account.</p>
<p>Currency exchange, at prevailing rates, is available on some cruises. Travelers checks and most major credit cards are accepted in the ports we visit. Proper ID is required when cashing travelers checks. We recommend you carry a small amount of local currency when visiting foreign ports, although credit cards are commonly accepted in shops and restaurants.</p>            </div> <!-- Close div: faq-answer -->

      <div class="faq-answer" question_id="customs-allowances">
      <strong></strong>
      United States residents must declare all articles acquired abroad and in their possession when they return to the U.S. This includes items purchased in "duty-free" shops. The duty-free exemption allowed for purchases or gifts for returning U.S. residents varies, depending on how long they have been out of the U.S. and which countries they have visited. The standard exemption for U.S. residents who have been abroad more than 48 hours is $600 - $800 USD, which may include one liter of alcohol (if you are at least 21), 100 cigars and 200 cigarettes.

Residents returning to the U.S. from the U.S. Virgin Islands may bring $1,200 USD worth of goods duty-free. The duty-free exemption for U.S. residents doesn't need to include items that are mailed back to the U.S.; those will be assessed for duty when they arrive. The duty-free exemption for a package mailed as a gift is $100 USD; the exemption for a package marked for personal use is $200 USD. Non-U.S. citizens should check with their local authorities for customs allowance information. For more specific customs information, be sure to attend the briefing by the Cruise Director before your ship reaches home port. (Check the daily onboard newsletter for time and place.) You can also obtain information before you sail by contacting the nearest U.S. Customs office (look under United States Government, Department of Treasury in your local phone book). You can also visit the U.S. Customs website - <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/">www.cbp.gov</a> - or call 1.202.927.6724 and ask for the brochure "Know Before You Go."

      <ul class="blue-box-bullets">
<li>No running, jumping or diving are permitted in the pool area</li>

<li>Guests must follow the rules posted on all signs in the pool or hot tub/whirlpool area.</li>
<li>Children under 16 require adult supervision at all times while using the hot tub.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Do Norwegian ships have adult only pools?</h4>
Yes. Some ships have pools that are adult-only. All regular pool rules also apply.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Are diapers of any type allowed in pools or hot tubs on Norwegian ships?</h4>
According to United States Public Health (U.S.P.H.) regulations, no diapers of any kind (child or adult) are permitted in the swimming pools, whirlpools or jacuzzis, including those marketed as "swimmers." 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Are floating devices allowed in pools on Norwegian ships?</h4>
Yes. Guests are allowed to bring floating devices in the pools (arm floats, tubes).

All outdoor pools contain salt water and are chlorinated in accordance with USPH regulations.<br />
All hot tubs are fresh water and are chlorinated in accordance with USPH regulations. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Are there lifeguards at pools on Norwegian ships?</h4>
As with many land-based hotels and resorts with swimming pools, Norwegian Cruise Line and all other major cruise lines provide conspicuous signage to alert guests that a lifeguard is not on duty. We also require that children under 12 are accompanied by an adult at all times. Close parental supervision of children is required at all Norwegian ship pools and whirlpools. It’s also safest to swim with a friend (rather than alone), especially when one’s swimming skills may not be the strongest. All swimmers in Norwegian pools must follow all rules posted in pool and hot tub/whirlpool areas and should take extra care with their own and their children’s safety. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Are Norwegian pools and hot tubs/whirlpools handicap accessible?</h4>
All Norwegian ships have pool lifts. The following ships have lifts for the hot tub/whirlpool: 
Pride of America, Norwegian Breakaway, Norwegian Epic and Norwegian Getaway.

      General Information: Tour Descriptions, Durations and Departure Times
The information provided on this website is designed to help you select the excursions most suited to your interests. The tour descriptions are as current and accurate as possible. Please note that occasionally changes in the descriptions do occur. Some tours will operate in an order that is different from; that presented in the tour descriptions.

Please note that departure times are subject to change.

Participation in activities and excursions may involve physical exertion, and may be potentially hazardous or dangerous. It is the responsibility of each individual to determine whether you are capable of engaging in any activity. Participation in any activity or excursion is at your own risk.

Photographs are for illustration purposes only used to represent the excursion experience and may not accurately depict the excursion, location, or activity indicated.

<strong>Prices</strong>
All prices are in U.S. dollars, capacity controlled and subject to change without notice. Prices for Hawaii only, DO NOT INCLUDE the additional Hawaiian State Tax that is assessed on all Shore Excursions. Prices include meals, refreshments as indicated in the tour description (including gratuities for these services), plus guide and entrance fees, unless otherwise noted. There is no charge for children under the age of 2 (at the time of sailing) who do not occupy a separate seat on most tours. Children's prices are only available as indicated at time of booking. Participants under the age of 13 pay child prices and participants 13 years of age and older pay adult prices (unless otherwise noted). An adult must accompany participants under the age of 18 on all tours. Due to weight and balance limitations as well as passenger 
safety and comfort, guests weighing 250 lbs. (113kg) or more (fully dressed) will be required to pay a surcharge to reserve extra space on the helicopter and all flightseeing tours.

<strong>Cancellation or Modification</strong>
Cruise schedules are subject to change at the discretion of the Captain, and may occasionally be affected by variations in arrival or departure times, inclement weather, and mechanical or equipment difficulties. NCL reserves the right to change Shore Excursion prices, itineraries and departure times without notice. Excursions are subject to cancellation or modification depending on the number of guests participating. NCL reserves the right to cancel a Shore Excursion for any reason, including inclement weather, and shall not be liable for any loss to participants. Participants holding tickets for canceled Shore Excursions will receive a full refund. Should it be necessary to abandon a Shore Excursion due to difficulties en route, NCL will arrange the best possible refund for participants according to the circumstances.

<strong>Refunds and Cancellation Fees</strong>
Most tours may be cancelled one day or more prior to sailing, any exceptions to this are noted in the tour descriptions on NCL.com. Tour cancellations which occur one day or more prior to sailing shall automatically receive a full refund on the credit card used to purchase such shore excursion tour, unless the tour has a more restrictive cancellation policy or unless a balance remains due to be paid on the guest’s reservation. In order to receive a full refund a guest must cancel their reservation on a shore excursion tour, one or more days prior to sailing. If a guest cancels a shore excursion tour reservation within the cut-off window (one day or more prior to sailing) a full refund shall be posted to the credit card used regardless of whether or not the individual who made the purchase is sailing. Please allow 7-10 business days for the credit to post to the credit card account. Shore excursion tours can be cancelled prior to the start of the sailing by contacting a Shore Excursion Agent at 1.866.625.1167.

In the instance that a tour cancellation is made by a guest outside of the cut-off date for such cancellations, the guest must request to cancel such shore excursion tour with the Shore Excursion Manager onboard. Once onboard, any refunds will be made to the onboard folio account of the Shore Excursion order contact person, not the original credit card used to secure the online order. This applies even in the event that shore excursions were purchased as a gift by someone who is not sailing. In the instance that at the end of the sailing, any onboard credit remains unused at the end of your sailing, such credit shall be refunded via check in the name of the Shore Excursion order contact person. Payment of the refund check will be mailed following sailing to the individual listed as the Shore Excursion order contact person.

All tours cancelled by guests less than 48 hours prior to arrival in the port where the tour is scheduled to operate are non-refundable. Please note that certain tours, such as overland tours, customized tours and tours with theater performances or special events may be subject to different cancellation fees. Check with the Shore Excursion Desk for details. If a flight departure is cancelled due to weather by the flight company in conjunction with the Shore Excursion Manager, a full credit will be provided. You can cancel a tour by returning the tour ticket to the Shore Excursion Desk and advising the staff of the cancellation. Refunds will be credited to the guest's onboard account.

It should be noted that in the instance that an online booking for a shore excursion is made and a balance remains on guest’s reservation, payment made for the online booking shall be applied to the remaining balance on guest’s reservation. In the instance a guest requests to cancel a shore excursion reservation and a balance remains due on the guest’s reservation, the online booking refund will not be made to guest until full payment of the reservation is received.

<strong>Guests with Disabilities</strong>
While NCL strives to make its Shore Excursion program available to all its guests, inherent tour venue limitations and/or tour operator limitations exist that are beyond NCL's control that limit the ability of guests with special needs to participate in certain Shore Excursions. We urge such guests to advise the Shore Excursion department of disabilities when requesting tours and to further meet with the Shore Excursion staff on board to discuss their disabilities as they relate to the unique characteristics of each Shore Excursion. We typically recommend independent transportation for the comfort and convenience of guests with disabilities.

<strong>Important Information</strong>
NCL makes arrangements for Guests for Shore Excursions solely for the convenience of the Guest; NCL does not act on behalf of or supervise the parties or persons who own, furnish, or operate such excursions, and the same are provided by independent contractors. NCL assumes no responsibility for, nor guarantees the performance of, any such excursion provider, and Guests acknowledge that NCL shall not be liable for losses or injuries arising from the acts or omissions of such provider.            </div> <!-- Close div: faq-answer -->

      <p>When it comes to what to wear, you can go resort casual or get decked-out and look your best - it’s your call. That’s the freedom of Freestyle Cruising. We even have special “Dress-Up or Not Night.” It’s the perfect opportunity to get your portrait taken with your family, that special someone or even with the ship’s Captain.</p>

<p><strong>Cruise Casual: the Freedom of Freestyle Cruising</strong></p>
<p>Dress cruise casual anytime during the day, in the buffet and in most specialty restaurants. For women, it includes summer and casual dresses, skirts, regular or capri pants, shorts, jeans and tops. Khakis, jeans, shorts and casual shirts are fine for men. Swimwear is acceptable at the buffet and outdoor restaurant, but a shirt or a cover-up and footwear are required.</p>

<p>Be sure to pack a sweater — the air conditioning can be chilly. Kids 12 and under are welcome to wear nice shorts in all our restaurants.</p>

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> We want you to be comfortable, but tank tops for men, flip flops, baseball caps, visors and jeans that are overly faded, with holes or tears and worn below the hips are not permitted in main dining rooms or specialty restaurants.</p>

<p><strong>All Decked-out: Smart Casual</strong></p>
<p>Dress smart casual in our more formal dining room or in our more upscale specialty restaurants. For women, it includes slacks or jeans, dresses, skirts and tops. For men, it's jeans or slacks with a collared shirt and closed-toed shoes. Kids 12 and under are welcome to wear nice shorts in all our restaurants. </p>

<p><strong>Ready for Adventure: Shore Excursions</strong></p>
<p>Think about the shore excursions you'll be taking and pack accordingly, including comfy walking shoes. For kids and adults it's good to pack a pair of closed-toed shoes. You can check within the specific shore excursion for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Special Events: Theme Nights and Parties</strong></p>
<p>Our newest event, Norwegian's Night Out, is the perfect opportunity to get dressed up for an evening of cocktails, fine dining and great entertainment. You may also want to pack an all-white ensemble for our iconic White Hot Party.</p>

      <p>Passengers <strong>should not bring</strong> the following items onboard any Norwegian Cruise Line ship:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Drones (Game Flying Device)</strong><br />
   Guests are not permitted to bring drones onboard for safety of other guests, as well as the welfare of the vessel.<br />
 <br />
 </li>
  <li><strong>Samsung Galaxy Note7</strong><br />
    In light of recent safety issues with the Samsung Galaxy Note7, we are asking our guests who own this model to please avoid traveling with this mobile device.  The Federal Aviation Administration has banned the Samsung Galaxy Note7 from all air travel, and until further notice, this device will be restricted from all Norwegian Cruise Line ships. Fire is one of the greatest threats at sea and due to the safety concerns these devices present, if one is found in a guest’s possession or unattended in a stateroom onboard, our policy instructs the crew to confiscate the device for safekeeping.  The device will remain in our possession, in a safe, monitored location, for the duration of the cruise.  Guests can reclaim their device at the conclusion of the cruise from the reception desk.<br />
    <br />

  <li><strong>Irons / Ironing Boards and Steamers</strong><br />
  Guests are not permitted to bring and use their own irons or steamers onboard. Norwegian Cruise Line carries a limited number of irons and ironing boards which can be loaned to guests for a few hours at a time. They can be requested through housekeeping or Guest Services Desk.<br />
Irons and steamers would both be taken from guests at embarkation and returned at the end of the sailing.<br />
<br />
</li>
  <li><strong>Animals of any kind</strong>, except service or guide animals, provided the passenger notifies Carrier prior to the cruise of his intention to bring such animal and agrees to take sole responsibility for any expense, damage, injuries or losses associated with or caused by such animal.<br />

        <strong>Caribbean, Bahamas, Bermuda, Alaska, Mexican Riviera, Or Canada &amp; New England Cruises</strong>
      </p>
      <p><u>For round-trip sailings (cruises that depart from and return to the same U.S. port)</u>, you may sail with either a valid passport, proof of citizenship and a valid government-issued photo I.D. (driver&rsquo;s license with a photo), or any other WHTI compliant document.</p>
      <p>Proof of Citizenship examples include:</p>
      <ul class="blue-box-bullets">
        <li>State certified  U.S. birth certificate</li>
        <li>Original certificate of U.S. naturalization</li>
        <li>Original certificate of U.S. citizenship</li>
        <li>U.S. Consular report of your birth abroad.</li>
        <li><strong>Baptismal paper, hospital certificates of birth and Puerto Rico birth certificates issued prior to 7/1/10 are not acceptable.</strong></li>
        <li>A U.S. citizen under the age of 16 do not require a government-issued photo ID.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><u>For open-jaw sailings (cruises that depart from one U.S. port and return to a different U.S. port)</u>, you are required to carry:</p>
      <ul class="blue-box-bullets">
        <li>A valid passport</li>
        <li>U.S. passport card</li>
        <li>U.S. or Canadian  Enhanced Drivers License</li>
        <li>Permanent residents of the U.S. are required to carry their valid ARC cards for boarding AND passport from their country of citizenship, if available.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note: If you miss your ship at its scheduled U.S. departure port and need to travel outside the U.S. to meet your ship, or should you unexpectedly need to depart the ship from a foreign port prior to the end of sailing, a passport would be required to leave or re-enter the U.S. by air.  To that end, Norwegian strongly recommends all guests to obtain a passport for their voyage on any Norwegian vessel.</p>
      <p><strong>All Itineraries</strong></p>
      <p>All guests must carry a valid passport, and if necessary, a multiple entry visa is required for entry into the United States (i.e. B-2 Visitors Visa), or a visa waiver. Please be sure to check with the proper agencies and authorities (such as your local immigration office) before you sail because we can't board you without the proper documents. Travelers from the 36 Visa Waiver Program (VWP) countries must have a machine-readable passport to enter the U.S. without a visa.&nbsp;<strong><u>All VWP travelers are required to obtain an electronic travel authorization prior to boarding a carrier to travel by air or sea to the U.S. under the VWP.</u></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Hawaii Cruises</strong> </p>
      <p> There&rsquo;s no need for a passport when you sail on any Hawai&lsquo;i inter-island cruise. If your ship never sails beyond the islands of Hawai&lsquo;i, all you need is a government-issued photo I.D. which includes a passport or a valid driver&rsquo;s license with a photo.  A U.S. citizen under the age of 16 do not require a government-issued photo ID.</p>
<p>
        <strong>Europe Cruises</strong>
</p>
      <p>A valid passport is required and in some cases, a tourist visa is also required.</p>

      <p style="font-size:14px;">The original FCC amount will be returned to the guests' profile. If an affected booking has a previously applied FCC (as a result of a previous suspended sailing), the enhanced value future cruise credit will not be applicable.  Bookings under this circumstance are not eligible for a cash refund and will receive the original value of the FCC back to the guests’ profile.</p>

<p>Note FCCs have no cash value and cannot be redeemed for cash.  If a guest opts to retain the FCC provided, the guest hereby agrees to all of NCL’s terms and conditions associated with the FCC, which can also be found on <a href="http://www.ncl.com/cruise-faq" title="www.ncl.com/cruise-faq">www.ncl.com/cruise-faq</a>. </p> 

<!-- Please be advised that at no time will an FCC be redeemable for cash, including but not limited to situations of possible future cruise suspensions, displacements, cancellations or if the FCC exceeds the time in which it must be used. -->

<p>To offer our guests even more flexibility for future vacation planning, some under some circumstances who hold outstanding Future Cruise Credits (FCC) may submit a request to convert their FCC to a monetary refund.

      <!-- OLD SMOKING POLICY PRIOR TO DEC 3 2019 -->
<!-- <p>As the health and well-being of our guests and crew is of the utmost importance, Norwegian Cruise Line will institute changes to its smoking policy for <strong>all sailings on or after November 1, 2014</strong>. The specific changes prohibit smoking on stateroom balconies and limit smoking in the casino to players.  On Norwegian Breakaway, smoking on The Waterfront will be permitted on the starboard side, except by the outdoor dining areas. (Smoking on The Waterfront is no longer permitted on Norwegian Getaway.)</p>
<p>Guests in the Garden Villas may smoke in their private garden and on their private sun decks.</p>
<p>Public areas throughout all our ships are smoke-free. If you smoke regular or electronic cigarettes, you can do so in designated areas only.  If you prefer pipes or cigars, you can smoke in the Cigar Bar or designated smoking lounge. Smoking cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, cigars and pipes is permitted in outdoor public guest spaces and open decks where designated by the ship's management based on the ship's specific characteristics and arrangement.  Smoking, including electronic cigarettes, is prohibited in or near venues serving food, the jogging track, outdoor sporting venues, The Haven outdoor areas and children's pool areas. On ships with The Waterfront, with the exception of Norwegian Joy, smoking is permitted on the starboard side excluding any food service areas. Active Casino players may smoke cigarettes in the Casino during gaming hours. Cigarette smoking is not permitted in any other indoor venue or location.</p>
<p>Guests are not permitted to smoke cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars or pipes in their staterooms or on their balconies. Cigar and pipe smoking in staterooms and on balconies is prohibited.  Smoking inside your stateroom or on your balcony will result in a $250 <span class="usd">USD</span> cleaning charge added to your onboard account. If cigarette burns on furniture, linens, towels or carpeting are detected; guests will be advised and charged for the damages. </p>
<p>Electronic cigarettes cannot be used in public areas where there is a No Smoking policy in force; simply because these cigarettes look so realistic and therefore other guests' perception is that we are not enforcing the No Smoking rule.</p> -->

      <p>Yes, unless you are issued a handy phone or pager, which requires at least 1 authorized pick up person to remain onboard in case the staff or child needs your assistance. The Youth Program Manager will inquire with the security team.</p>
<p>This policy is in place for the safety of your child. Pagers and handy phones do not work ashore from the ship.</p>
<p>Handy phones or pagers will be given out for the following reasons:</p>
<li>-If your child is in diapers</li>
<li>-If your child or staff needs your assistance beyond the scope of the youth programs care provided</li>
<br />
<p>Youth Program Manager reserves the right to issue a handy phone or pager to parents if the situation with the child requires parent/pick-up person assistance.</p> 

<p>If a handy phone or pager is issued to you and your child is signed into the program, not responding to a page or call within 15 minutes will result in a $75.00 fee and your child will be dismissed from the program.</p>

<p>If a handy phone or pager is issued a fee of $150.00 will be applied to your onboard account if the device is not returned or if it is returned broken.</p>

      <p>Yes, although children are registered for and placed in the appropriate age group based on their date of birth at the time of sailing for quality programs. For quality programs, certain hours within the program, called Feel Free Play, are designated for friends and siblings to play together. When Feel Free Play is not in session, children are placed in their appropriate age groups for programming. No exceptions will be made to age bump to a different age group.</p>
<!--<p>Children of different ages can also play together during Port Play and Late Night Fun Zone. For safety concerns 3-5 year olds may be separated yet efforts will be made to keep siblings together.</p>-->

      <strong></strong>
      <p>Parents can allow their 10 - 12 year old to sign themselves out of Splash Academy after two hours of participation.</p>

 <strong>It is recommended for parents to make the first initial drop off so the Youth Staff have the opportunity to meet you. In order to sign themselves in and out of the program, the 10-12 year olds must have their key cards and their parents location.</strong>

<p>The authorization ends nightly at 10:30 p.m. Therefore, at 10:30 p.m., the 10 -12 year old will be signed out from Splash Academy, unless the parent registers the child for Late Night Fun Zone.</p>

<p>If the child does not wish to remain in Splash Academy for the two hours, the parent or another authorized pick up person or another authorized guardian can pick up the child at any time.</p>

<p>Please refer to FAQ regarding authorized pick up people.</p>

<p>The sign out authorization does not apply on Port Days.</p>

<p>It is recommended that parents decline the authorization if they do not want their 10 - 12 year old unattended or if the child has a moderate to severe special need. It is also recommended for safety purposes, to establish a meet-up plan for 10-12 year olds who are given the sign out authorization so you are aware of where they are when not in the program.</p>            </div> <!-- Close div: faq-answer -->
